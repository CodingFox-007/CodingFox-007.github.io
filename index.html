        <p>Hello, my name is Draven Livingston and this is the first website I have made.
            I would like to persue a career in software and webpage development. In my
             spare time, I like to work on small projects (such as Scratch projects) to 
             keep improving my coding skills. I am a senior in high school and I am thankful
             that I have had the opportunity to take college classes at Indian Hills.
        </p>
