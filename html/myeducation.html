            <p id="education">Homeschool has benifited me in so many ways.
                The main reason why I feel this way is because I am able to 
                focus better on my school work and I get to study my areas 
                of interest. Another reason why I have enjoyed homeschool is 
                because I get to spend more time with my family and I get to 
                go out in the community often.

            <p id="education">I have been enjoying my college classes that I 
                have been taking at Indian Hills. So far I have taken: Introduction to Computers, Introduction to Psychology, and
                Beginning Webpage Development. I will be taking more classes in software devolopment and programming since that 
                is what I would like to persue for my career.
