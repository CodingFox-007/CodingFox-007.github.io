        <h3>PROFILE</h3>

            <div>              
            I am just starting my working career,
             but I have a lot of experience with helping in the community.
             I look forward to any opportunity to help others.
             I am currently taking a class on computers because I think
             it is something that will help me in the work force.

                2018- current
                I have helped to serve food to people in the community at Blessings Soup Kitchen. I have had the chance to talk with the patrons and wash the dishes. My 4-h group and I also made desserts to hand out at the soup kitchen.</li>
            
           <li><p>Volunteer with 4-H</p>
            2018- current
            While in 4-H I have had many opportunities to help in the community. I volunteered to plant flowers around the local library and the 4-H building to make the area around them look nicer. I have brought my rabbit to the nursing home for the residents to pet. While at the state fair I was in charge of monitoring a group of children to make sure they were able to safely enjoy their time there. My 4-H group and I also picked up litter to help clean up the community.</li>
            
            <li><p>Welding Workshop</p>
            April 2023- May 2023
            Attended and completed a 4-week course to learn the fundamentals of welding. During this course I learned proper safety procedures. I was introduced to the equipment that is used in welding and learned how to use it. Each week I was able to create and complete my own project idea. One of the welding projects I completed got a blue ribbon with 4-H.</li>
